Cloud computing : Provisioning computing services (cpu, memory, storage, network) over the internet
with the elastic in nature, with self-service , shared responsibility and pay as you go features.
EC2 : Elastic compute Cloud- 
S3 : simple storage service
RDS : Relational database service
Lambda : serverless computing
VPC : virtual private cloud : its a isolated networking area.

devops is a part of software development life cycles (SDLC) , it is combination of developement, operations
and some part of testing and as well as monitoring.

SDLC is typically consist of multiple phaces like 

- requirements gatherings
    Conflience it is used to document the requirements, status of the project.

- designing (Design templates are used to design)

- developement- software languages used like Java,python,.net, c, c++ etc 
    tools used git, maven, jenkins

- testing- types of testing are unit testing, integration testing (end to end testing)

- operations

    Environment set up- can be done in data center or in cloud, 
        some of the croud service providers are AWS, GCP (google cloud platform), Azure

    deployment - Jenkins tool is used, shell scripting, ansible, Docker, kubernetes,

- monitoring

    Application monitoring - monitoring application errors, logs and performance metrix 
     (splunk is used for monitoring application logs)

    System monitoring- monitoring cpu, memory, disk usage and system related issues 
      AppDynamics, Grafana, Prometheus are used for system monitoring

- feedback
